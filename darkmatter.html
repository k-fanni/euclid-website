                    <h2>Normal matter</h2>
                    <p>Normal matter consists of the <strong>elemental particles</strong> described in the famous
                        Standard Model of particle physics. This includes quarks and electrons, which together form atoms.</p>
                    <p>We know that normal matter attracts other normal matter, depending on how much mass it has, via
                        gravity. This force explains why apples fall towards the Earth. It also explains why the Earth
                        revolves around the Sun, and the Sun orbits the centre of the Milky Way galaxy.</p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, normal matter turns out to be <em>only a small fraction of what the Universe
                        contains</em>. 95% of the Universe is made up of dark matter and dark energy. These are words
                        astronomers have come up with to give a name to the mysterious, invisible side of the Universe.</p>

                                15% warm intergalactic gas, 28% cool intergalactic gas, 4% hot gas in galaxy clusters, 5% hot gas in galaxies,

                    <h2>Dark matter</h2>
                    <p>Dark matter is a <em>hypothetical form of matter</em> that appears not to interact with light or
                        the electromagnetic field. Dark matter is <strong>implied by gravitational effects which cannot
                        be explained by general relativity unless more matter is present than can be seen</strong>.
                        Such effects occur in the context of formation and evolution of galaxies, gravitational lensing,
                        the observable universe's current structure, mass position in galactic collisions, the motion of
                        galaxies within galaxy clusters, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies.</p>
                    <p>When cosmologists incorporated dark matter into their computer models of the Universe, they found
                        that not only could they more easily explain the way galaxies moved but they could also match the
                        puzzling speed with which galaxies seemed to form in cosmic history. The same was true of other
                        large scale structures such as clusters of galaxies.</p>
                </section><!-- dark matter -->

                <!-- dark energy -->
                <section>
                    <h2>Dark energy</h2>
                    <p>Measurements in the 1990s showed that the rate at which the Universe expands is accelerating.
                        This was completely unexpected because nothing in known physics could produce this effect.
                        The Universe has continuously expanded since the Big Bang, but it was assumed that this expansion
                        rate would slow down over time because it is resisted by the gravity of all matter in the Universe.</p>
                    <p>In keeping with the naming of the mysterious dark matter, astronomers began referring to whatever
                        was causing the acceleration as 'dark energy'. This unidentified component of the Universe is thought
                        to be present in such a large quantity that it overwhelms all other components of matter and energy
                        put together. According to the most recent estimates from ESA's Planck mission, <strong>dark energy
                        contributes 68 percent of the matter-energy density of the Universe</strong>.</p>
