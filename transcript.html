        The video moves through a 3D animation of a galaxy.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> There are mysteries in deep space. The nature
        of dark matter and dark energy has perplexed astronomers for decades.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A 3D animation of stars is shown, with a reflection moving in the foreground.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> But ESA's Euclid Space Telescope is now ready
        to help. Its first science images are about to be released.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A 3D animation of the Euclid space telescope rotating horizontally is shown.
        The video switches to a man talking, and a title is shown with the following text:
        Roland Vavrek, Euclid Deputy Project Scientist
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Roland Vavrek:</span> I started to work for Euclid in 2013, 10
        years ago. Over that time the
        spacecraft has been designed,
        it has been manufactured, it has been assembled, tested and verified.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        An illustration of Euclid's planned path in space is shown in
        comparison
        with the path of the
        James Webb Space Telescope and the Gaia Space Telescope.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Roland Vavrek:</span> The mission is almost ready to start its
        six
        years of collection of data.
    
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches to a man looking at a computer screen, then it
        switches to another man
        talking, and a title is shown with the following text: René Laureijs, Euclid Project
        Scientist
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">René Laureijs:</span> ERO is an acronym for early release
        observations. A program where we observe a
        number of very
        interesting targets, which are appealing for the public but also have scientific
        value.
    
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches to a woman talking, and a title is shown with
        the
        following text: Sara Nieto,
        Euclid Scientific Archive
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Sara Nieto:</span> I've seen the first ERO image and had this
        enormous pleasure. It's absolutely
        stunning so this is a very
        exciting moment.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A rotating globe is shown with the photo of the universe on it.
        There
        are
        different shades of
        grey patches where these is no photo on the globe.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Sara Nieto:</span> Scientists are still working on the images
        to be
        ready for the release.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches to a man talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">René Laureijs:</span> The result is really astonishing.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video moves through a photo of the universe. The video stops
        moving
        and Euclid appears on
        screen. An animation is shown of Euclid projecting squares across the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> Euclid is designed to map approximately 1.5 to
        two
        billion galaxies.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches to a photo of the universe, with Euclid in the
        bottom
        right corner. Different
        shades of grey squares show up across the photo.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> By analysing the shapes and distribution of
        those
        galaxies, astronomers will gain
        clues to the nature of
        the dark matter and dark energy.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches to a man talking. A title is shown with the
        following
        text: Hervé Aussel,
        Euclid Science Ground segment Scientist
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Hervé Aussel:</span> For the first time, with Euclid we can
        take a
        sample of the galaxy with for which
        have no stellar mass,
        which have no stars forming, etc.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A 3D animation of a web-like structure is shown. The video
        switches
        back
        to the man talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Hervé Aussel:</span> And I can go and measure very accurately
        how
        much total mass, how much dark
        matter mass there is in
        them, and that's what I want to do with Euclid on my side.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A woman is looking at a computer screen and talking. The computer
        screen
        is shown.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> During its mission, Euclid will generate a
        vast
        amount of data, the equivalent of a
        million DVDs that must
        be stored and made available to the world's astronomers.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video shows a man talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">René Laureijs:</span> These images together will give us the
        total
        structure of the universe up to a
        loop back time of 10
        billion years, so we can follow the evolution of the structure over 10 billion
        years.
    
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A 3D animation of a web-like structure is shown. The video
        switches
        back
        to the man talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">René Laureijs:</span> And this is really the aim of Euclid, to
        make
        this giant 3D distribution map
        and derive from it the
        properties of dark matter and dark energy.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video shows a woman talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Sara Nieto:</span> Now that we have real data in place, that's
        really a game changer for us.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The woman is shown looking at a computer screen. The computer
        screen
        is
        shown.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Sara Nieto:</span> So we now can test everything that we can
        offer
        this real data to our interfaces
        which is really, really
        exciting for us.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        The video switches back to the woman talking.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Sara Nieto:</span> So this is a very emotional moment and very
        challenging also.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        A man is looking at a computer screen. The computer screen is
        shown.
        There is images of the
        universe on the computer screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="speaker">Narrator:</span> There are cosmic secrets in these images,
        invisible to the human eye but waiting to
        be revealed by computer
        analysis and our understanding of physics. Euclid's scientific mission into the dark
        side of
        the universe is about
        begin.
